            <h2>Terms of Service</h2>
            <p>Welcome to Kunda Web Solutions. By accessing and using our website or services, you agree to be bound by the following terms. Please read them carefully. If you do not agree to these terms, you may not access or use our services.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Consultation and Project Scope:</strong> All projects begin with an initial consultation, which helps define the projectâ€™s scope, timeline, deliverables, and payment terms. Any changes to the scope during the project may result in additional fees or an extension of deadlines.</li>
                <li><strong>Client Responsibilities:</strong> Clients are responsible for providing all necessary materials, including text, images, and feedback, promptly. Delays in providing this content may result in project delays and could affect the agreed delivery timeline.</li>
                <li><strong>Payment Terms:</strong> Payment schedules will be outlined in the project contract. Failure to adhere to the agreed payment terms may result in project suspension or cancellation. Additional features or revisions not included in the initial agreement will be billed separately.</li>
                <li><strong>Project Completion and Ownership:</strong> Upon successful project completion and full payment, ownership of the website, content, and associated assets will transfer to the client. Kunda Web Solutions reserves the right to retain a portfolio copy of the project.</li>
                <li><strong>Revisions and Amendments:</strong> Revisions may be requested based on the scope defined in the consultation. Major changes outside the scope will require an additional agreement and may incur further costs.</li>
                <li><strong>Termination of Services:</strong> Either party may terminate the project if a material breach of the agreement occurs. In the event of termination, the client will be responsible for payment of work completed up to that point.</li>
                <li><strong>Liability:</strong> Kunda Web Solutions is not liable for any damages resulting from the use or inability to use the website or services. This includes but is not limited to lost profits, interruptions in business, or loss of data.</li>
